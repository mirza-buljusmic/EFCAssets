Time allowing, some front end and cosmetic work will be done. A decision has to made regarding the purchase price field, as .NET Core has trouble validating decimal numbers with comma as decimal separator, if the field should be left as decimal (hence making it troublesome to enter decimal values), or simply made to an <i>integer</i> field.
                        <br /><br />

                            <li>Make decimal numbers with comma as decimal separator work (cannot make the .net core validation to work)</li><br />
                            <li>Make the display of dates to ISO standard, .net Core shows only en-us standard</li><br />

An asset must belong to a category. List of all active assets is shown with assets that have past their <i>End of life</i> date in red. Assets <b>cannot</b> be deleted, ony deactivated. Reason for this is historical financial functionality, otherwise it will affect the correctnes of reports. Assets can be reactivated under the <i>Admin</i> menu.</td>
